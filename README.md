Funtion: a signal processing framework that can generate several degradation algorithms by simply switching several key parameters．
The algoirthms include mosaic speech, chimaeric speech, sine-wave carrier and noise carrier channel vocoders for cochlear implant simulations, and pulsatile Gaussian-enveloped-Tones vocoder for cochlear implant simulation.

Atomic sound is defined as the sound signal resynthesized using tiny sound atoms, i.e. Gaussian enveloped pulses．
The original idea is from the Gaussian-Enveloped-tone vocoder which was proposed to simulate the pulsatile stimulation of cochlear implants.   The first ever proposal for using the Gaussian-Enveloped-Tone to study hearing may be Gabor(1942) which borrow ideas from the quantum theory.   The uncertainty theory in both quantum theory and signal processing share the same mathmatical basis.
   
The following is the parameter introduction  
Inputs:  
in_sig　input signal  
fs　sampling rate (Hz)  
p　paramters  
p.pre_emp　　0. Without pre-emphasis; 1(default). With pre-emphasis  
p.num_Ch　　　number of frequency channels  
p.fre_range     analysis frequency range (Hz)  
           p.env_cut　the cutoff frequency for envelope extraction within each channel (Hz)  
           p.rat_pCh　pulse rate per channel (pps or Hz)  
           p.max_Ch_num　number of selection of the channels with maximum information  
           p.max_mod　mode of selection of the channels with maximum information. The default criterion is the channels with maximum intensity  
           p.bfilt_typ　type of bandpass filter bank, 1. Gammatone, only used for >30 num_Ch, 2. Butterworth  
           p.tim_typ　the type of sampling point                                     
                    1 randomized within each frame for each band;　
                    2 low to high band;

                    4 Peak in each channel-frame  
           ％p.jit_max　maximum jitter time (s); default = 0 s; may be used when p.tim_typ = 2 or 3 to reduce the regularity?   
           p.carr_typ　carrier type; 1.Origial temporal fine structure (TFS) from the in_sig; 2. sine wave; 3. band-limited noise  
           p.block_T(optional) 　the duration of mosaic blocks  
           p.Spread　dB/oct
